# simple_microprocessor
This project involves implementation of a simple RISC microprocessor capable of handling 4 instructions namely ADD - arithmetic operation, BR - branch instructions, LDW &amp; STW - memory operations. The implementation involves a pipelined simplescalar processor with 5 stages namely: Instruction fetch, Instruction decode and operand fetch, Execute, Memory and Write-back operations. Pipeline registers are used to transfer the pipeline information between stages and constructed 8 16-bit registers, 16-bit Program counter, 3-bit Conditional register and 256 byte memory. The ISA is fixed length and consists of 16-bit opcodes.
